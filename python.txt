From now on, we suppose that you are using Anaconda python distribution.


To change python version, creating a new conda environment:	https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activate-env
	conda search python - lists available python versions
	
	conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda	# py367 becomes the name of the environment
	conda info --envs							# lists the environments, your current environment is highlighted with an asterisk (*)
	
	conda list -n myenv							# If the environment is not activated, in your Terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt
	conda list									# If the environment is activated, in your Terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt
	
	
	
To determine the current Python version:
	1. python --version
	2. >>> python
	   >>> import sys
	   >>> print(sys.version)
