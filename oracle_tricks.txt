sqlplus: to log into an Oracle server and do sql commands without a GUI from the command line

	sqlplus userName/password@tns
	
	sqlplus userName@tns - sqlplus will ask for the password@tns
	
	where sqlplus - displays from which location sqlplus is used. Useful when we have more than 1 ODP.NET client installed
	
	tnsping net_service_name
		The TNSPING utility determines whether the listener for a service on an Oracle Net network can be reached successfully.
		net_service_name must exist in tnsnames.ora file or the name service in use, such as NIS.
		
	Net Manager:
	Database Configuration Assistant
	
	Enterprise Manager:
		Available on https://localhost:5500/em (https protocol is important!)

Install/uninstall Oracle client:

	C:\Oracle\product\12.1.0\client_1\oui\bin\setup.exe - this starts the installer where the client can be deleted from
	C:\Oracle\product\12.1.0\client_1\odp.net\managed\x64 - configure.bat - registers providers in machine.config regarding .NET?
	unconfigure.bat - execute before uninstalling the product

Good things

	select date'2016-02-02' from dual;

	// Oracle server on my comp
	SYSTEM 	/ {password}	--> normal user
	SYS 	/ {password}	--> SYSDBA role is necessary to be selected, otherwise user cannot connact to the database. It is worth connecting to the container (seed) db (SYS is the super user)
	Service name: orcl
				  pdborcl - this is the pluggable database, this is what we want to connect to and we create the new users for the pdborcl service

		So we need to connect to the pdb database using "system" be will be unable to do so. The solution is these 2 sql commands:
		http://krishanjaglan.blogspot.hu/2014/10/ora-01033-when-connecting-to-pdb.html
			ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ALL OPEN;
			ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ALL SAVE STATE;
			
		exp system@ORCLPDB owner=scott file=c:\temp\scott.dmp
		imp system@ORCLPDB FROMUSER=scott TOUSER=scott file=c:\temp\scott.dmp	// FROMUSER=scott van benne a dmp file-ban kiexportálja, 
																			// TOUSER-nek pedig a target adatbázisban léteznie kell mert a tool nem hozza létre a user-t!
